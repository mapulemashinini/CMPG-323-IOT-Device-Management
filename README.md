Demonstrating Repository Pattern Concepts

Design patterns are general repeatable and reusable solutions for general issues and problems the software engineers face during development, they are not language-specific and do not have cross-platform or domain issues, they just ease complexities related to design or reduce the risk when trying to adopt an unexamined design or methodology.

Benefits of Repository Pattern

* It centralizes data logic or business logic and service logic.
* It gives a substitution point for the unit tests.
* Provides a flexible architecture.
* If you want to modify the data access logic or business access logic, you donâ€™t need to change the repository logic.
